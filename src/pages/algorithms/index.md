## Algorithms

An algorithm is like a recipe. It's a series of unambiguous steps you take in order to achieve a specific outcome.

A computer will take an alghoritm as a input and produce the desired output after following all the required steps.

Some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms.

freeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews.
