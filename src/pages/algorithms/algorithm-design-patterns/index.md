## Algorithm Design Patterns

A algorithm design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Design patterns were originally grouped into three categories: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns.

### Creational patterns

This design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

### Structural patterns

This patterns are used to ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

### Behavioral patterns

Behavioarl patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.
